			<p>The Social Accountability (SAc) module is one of the main activities of the 26th Asia-Pacific Regional Scout Jamboree held on 28 December 2009 – 3 January 2010 at the Philippine Scouting Center for the Asia-Pacific Region, Mt. Makiling, Los Baños, Laguna.  It is a project of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines (BSP) implemented by the Ten Outstanding Boy Scouts of the Philippines Association, Inc. (TOBSPA), funded by a grant from the Affiliated Network for Social Accountability for East Asia and the Pacific (ANSA-EAP).</p>

<p>The SAc module is a pioneering activity as the basics of social accountability are attempted to be presented in a different way, as in a jamboree setting consistent with the principle of "learning by doing" – catered for the appreciation of young adults who are being molded into being vigilant vanguards of public rights and services.  It is an orienteering module that facilitates experiential learning in citizens’ participation in governance.  Equipped with monitoring/assessment tools, the Scouts ventured in a mission to explore the condition of public service delivery in a particular community.  This is designed to motivate them to pursue social accountability as a long-term interest and advocacy.</p>

<p>The SAc module was implemented for three (3) days – December 29-31, 2009 attended by two thousand seven hundred forty four (2,744) Scouts from the Asia-Pacific region.  With community immersion as the primary method, the module exposed the Scouts to the actual use of social accountability techniques in engaging both government and fellow citizens to improve public services.  Moreover, the openness of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines through the active involvement of its outstanding scouts in the conception, development and implementation of the social accountability module is a model for creating avenues for the young members of our society to get involved in seemingly adult concepts of peoples participation and good governance.</p>

<p>TOBSPA members served as volunteers and members of the jamboree International Service team (IST) during the implementation of the module.  Eight Scouts and Scoutmasters from Valenzuela Council also served as module staff.</p>

<p>To ensure smooth implementation of the activity, TOBSPA coordinated with the Los Baños local government, Department of Education (DepEd), and target communities through a series of meetings with DepEd officials, municipal authorities of Los Baños, led by its Municipal Mayor Hon. Ceasar Perez and the community officers of barangays Bambang, Baybayin, Malinta, Mayondon and Bayog.</p>
